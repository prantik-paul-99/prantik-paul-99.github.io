## Research Projects
**Common-sense Reasoning in Bangla | A Question Answering Bot that knows beyond the context**
- This is my NLP based undergraduate thesis under the supervision of [Dr Rifat Shahriyar](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/rifat)
- We aimed at building an artificially intelligent system that will be able to incorporate common-sense reasoning in crucial tasks currently performed by intelligent agents. Focusing on natural language processing, we selected the task of text-based question answering in Bangla for this project which was a novel work in this language. We initially built a knowledge graph for Bangla, which worked as the knowledge base for the system to incorporate relevant knowledge with contextual knowledge for answering the questions. We are currently working to furnish this work and looking for scopes to apply common-sense reasoning in relevant fields.

**A study on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) to enhance Security of Online Identity**
- Ongoing Research Project under the supervision of [Dr Md Sadek Ferdous](https://msferdous.info/)
- SSI is a distinct online user identity that invalidates the need for multiple user identities for multiple applications. We are exploring effective ways to use decentralized systems for implementing SSI. Our end goal is to ideally provide the entire control of user data to the user itself instead of third-party applications, ensuring utmost privacy and data-security for the users.

**Radio Frequency Interference Mitigation through Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques**
- Ongoing Independent Reseach Project with Multiple Collaborators
- We are currently working on a comprehensive review of the AI methods used for this purpose. Our end goal is to provide an automated pipeline to remove interference from astronomical data from telescopes.
